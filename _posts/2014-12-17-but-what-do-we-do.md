I recently had the chance to visit the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, Netherlands in part to see their '[The View From Here](http://vanabbemuseum.nl/en/programme/detail/?tx_vabdisplay_pi1%5Bptype%5D=24&tx_vabdisplay_pi1%5Bproject%5D=1234&cHash=bca6ff87011bdfd3e4bf1eb80adc6fe4)' exhibition. The exhibit featured excerpts from films created over the last hundred years by various Dutch documentary makers.

Among this collection, there was a short film entitled 'But What Do We Do?' that particularly resonated with me. It was created by [Leonard Henny](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Henny) (in Dutch), a graduate of the Dutch Film Academy, University of Amsterdam, and MIT, during his tenure at Stanford in 1966. It follows an American engineer struggling with the moral qualms of working for a defense contractor during the Vietnam War. 

It's probably best to let the film speak for itself. It has been uploaded to YouTube in two parts, both linked below.
