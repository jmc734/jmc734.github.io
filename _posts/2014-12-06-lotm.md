After reading Curtis McEnroe's [article](http://cmcenroe.me/2014/12/05/days-in-month-formula.html) about creating a formula to calculate the number of days in a month, inspired by JS byte-slashers like [219 Byte Tron](http://quaxio.com/tron/), [140 Byte Tetris](http://www.i-programmer.info/news/167-javascript/3799-tetris-in-140-bytes.html), and the work over at [p01](http://www.p01.org/releases/), I got to thinking about a way to make it more compact.<!-- more --> First off, here is what Curtis came up with:

{% highlight js %}
function curtisMcEnroe(x) {
    return 28 + (x + Math.floor(x / 8)) % 2 + 2 % x + 2 * Math.floor(1 / x);
}
{% endhighlight %}

For future reference, the body of that function is **47 bytes**.

> Like Curtis, I will be considering handling leap years out of scope

My first thought was to go bitwise. I started out by laying out a table of month indices, the length of each month, and the binary representations of those two numbers.

| Index | Length | Index (Binary) | Length (Binary) |
|-------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1     | 31     | 0001           | 0001 1111       |
| 2     | 28     | 0010           | 0001 1100       |
| 3     | 31     | 0011           | 0001 1111       |
| 4     | 30     | 0100           | 0001 1110       |
| 5     | 31     | 0101           | 0001 1111       |
| 6     | 30     | 0110           | 0001 1110       |
| 7     | 31     | 0111           | 0001 1111       |
| 8     | 31     | 1000           | 0001 1111       |
| 9     | 30     | 1001           | 0001 1110       |
| 10    | 31     | 1010           | 0001 1111       |
| 11    | 30     | 1011           | 0001 1110       |
| 12    | 31     | 1100           | 0001 1111       |

I stared at it for a bit and got nowhere, so I decided to take a systematic approach. I constructed the [K-map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map) below, where the two MSBs of the month index are the bits on the top and the two LSBs are on the side. The K-map was populated with the LSB of the month length and the `-` character represents a "Don't Care".  

<table>
    <tr>
        <th class="no-border-bottom"></th>
        <th>00</th><th>01</th>
        <th>11</th>
        <th>10</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th class="no-border-bottom border-right">00</th>
        <td class="border-right">-</td>
        <td class="border-right">0</td>
        <td class="border-right" style="background-color: #77C470">1</td>
        <td style="background-color: #77C470">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th class="no-border-bottom border-right">01</th>
        <td class="border-right" style="background-color: #FF8080">1</td>
        <td class="border-right" style="background-color: #FF8080">1</td>
        <td class="border-right">-</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th class="no-border-bottom border-right">11</th>
        <td class="border-right" style="background-color: #FF8080">1</td>
        <td class="border-right" style="background-color: #FF8080">1</td>
        <td class="border-right">-</td><td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th class="no-border-bottom border-right">10</th>
        <td class="no-border-bottom border-right">0</td>
        <td class="no-border-bottom border-right">0</td>
        <td class="no-border-bottom border-right" style="background-color: #77C470">-</td>
        <td class="no-border-bottom" style="background-color: #77C470">1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

From the K-map, the following expression can be derived, where w is the MSB and z is the LSB:

$$
( \bar{w} \cdot z ) + ( w \cdot \bar{z} ) = w \oplus z
$$

Fantastic. I could XOR the MSB and LSB of the index to get the LSB of the length. I could then OR that with `0b00011110` (30) which would tell me if a month is 30 or 31 days. 

{% highlight js %}
function bitwise(x) {
    return 30 | (x >> 3 ^ x) & 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

That left the body of the function at only **14 bytes**. The logical next step was to carry that approach on to the next LSB. If you take a look at the index/length table above, you'll notice that there every length except the 28 has a 1 in that position. That makes using a K-map useless and left me with a few options:

1. I could use three right shifts and three ANDs to determine if the index is 2
2. I could use an equality operator to determine if the index is 2
3. I could store the result of the calculation for the LSB then use that and the index to determine the next LSB

This is the point at which I started to deviate from course. The obvious choice is option #2 but that would be too easy and I'd have to rename my function to something else because I would no longer be exclusively using bitwise operators. I couldn't have that. Suffice it to say, I went forward with option #3. 

> The function for option #2 is at the bottom of the page. It ended up being only **25 bytes** but interestingly was about twice as slow as option #3[^1]. 

This next step wasn't done with a systematic approach like the first. Going back to the staring at the numbers technique, I noticed that the first operation would spit out 30 for February and that February's index was the only index that produced a 30 from the first operation that had a 0 in the first and third bit postiions. That meant that all I had to do to identify which month had a length of 28 was to check if there was a 0 in the first and third bit position of the index an the LSB of the output from the previous operation. That gave me this:

{% highlight js %}
function bitwise(x) {
    var y;
    return (y = 30 | (x >> 3 ^ x) & 1) ^ (~(x >> 2 | x | y) & 1) << 1
}
{% endhighlight %}

which is only **43 bytes**! Success. That is definitely more compact but I had an inkling that it would faster too. I popped the two functions into [jsPerf](http://jsperf.com/calculating-length-of-month/4) and it turns out it was. That gave me another rabbit hole to go down.

# How fast can I make this thing?

Like bitwise operators seemed like an obvious choice for shrinking the function, so to did lookup tables for making it faster. I simply put the length of each month in an array with padding element at the front so that I could still use the 1-based index without a subtraction operation. I came up with this:

{% highlight js %}
var t = [0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];
function lookup(x) {
    return t[x];
}
{% endhighlight %}

It was fast but not that fast[^1]. I thought back to the index/length table and remembered that the only bits that changed for the length were the two LSBs. And since there are only 12 months (13 with a padding month), I could fit all of those sets of bits into a single 32-bit integer. That gave me the bits `11 10 11 10 11 11 10 11 10 11 00 11 00` which is equal to `0x3BBEECC`. Now with that magic number, all I needed to do was shift the right bits into the right position and OR them with 28. 



{% highlight js %}
function lookupBitwise(x) {
    return 28 | (0x3BBEECC >> x >> x) & 3;
}
{% endhighlight %}

That was better[^1] and it turned out to only take **20 bytes**, smaller then my attempt at making a small version. 

## Results

Take a look at the [jsPerf](http://jsperf.com/calculating-length-of-month/4) page to how they compare speed wise. Below is a compilation of all of the different functions I came up with:

{% highlight js linenos %}
/**
 * Length of the Month  
 */
 
var lotm = {

    lookupTable: [0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31],

    curtisMcEnroe: function(x) {
        return 28 + (x + Math.floor(x / 8)) % 2 + 2 % x + 2 * Math.floor(1 / x);
    },

    bitwise: function(x) {
        var y;
        return (y = 30 | (x >> 3 ^ x) & 1) ^ (~(x >> 2 | x | y) & 1) << 1
    },
    
    bitwiseEqual: function(x) {
        return 28 | (x >> 3 ^ x) & 1 | (x !== 2) << 1; 
    },

    lookup: function(x) {
        return this.lookupTable[x];
    },

    lookupBitwise: function(x) {
        return 28 | (0x3BBEECC >> x >> x) & 3;
    },

    bigSwitch: function(x) {
        switch (x) {
            case 1: return 31;
            case 2: return 28;
            case 3: return 31;
            case 4: return 30;
            case 5: return 31;
            case 6: return 30;
            case 7: return 31;
            case 8: return 31;
            case 9: return 30;
            case 10: return 31;
            case 11: return 30;
            case 12: return 31;
        }
    },

    bigIf: function(x) {
        if (x === 1) x = 31;
        else if (x === 2) x = 28;
        else if (x === 3) x = 31;
        else if (x === 4) x = 30;
        else if (x === 5) x = 31;
        else if (x === 6) x = 30;
        else if (x === 7) x = 31;
        else if (x === 8) x = 31;
        else if (x === 9) x = 30;
        else if (x === 10) x = 31;
        else if (x === 11) x = 30;
        else if (x === 12) x = 31;
        return x;
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}
